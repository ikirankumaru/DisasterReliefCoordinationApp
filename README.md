# AI-Powered Disaster Relief Coordination App

## MVP Requirements

1. **User Registration and Authentication:**

   - Implement user registration and authentication for volunteers, relief organizations, and affected individuals.

2. **Real-Time Disaster Monitoring:**

   - Utilize GeminiAPI to monitor and analyze real-time data from weather forecasts, seismic activity reports, and social media for early disaster detection.

3. **Disaster Alert and Notification System:**

   - Send timely alerts and notifications to users in affected areas based on AI-driven predictions and official disaster alerts.

4. **Resource Management Dashboard:**

   - Provide a dashboard for relief organizations to manage and update available resources (e.g., food, water, medical supplies) and their distribution status.

5. **Volunteer Coordination:**

   - Enable volunteers to register their availability, skills, and location. Use AI to match volunteers with specific needs based on capabilities and proximity.

6. **Communication and Collaboration Tools:**

   - Implement messaging and collaboration features to facilitate communication between relief organizations, volunteers, and affected individuals. Include translation capabilities.

7. **Mapping and Navigation Assistance:**

   - Integrate maps with real-time data overlays to display disaster zones, relief centers, road closures, and evacuation routes. Use AI for optimized routing.

8. **Community Support and Donations:**

   - Allow users to donate funds or resources directly through the app. AI can suggest critical needs based on real-time assessments and user contributions.

9. **Feedback and Reporting System:**

   - Implement a system for users to provide feedback on relief efforts and report incidents or emerging needs. Use AI to analyze feedback for response improvements.

10. **Data Security and Privacy:**
    - Ensure compliance with data protection regulations and implement robust security measures to protect user information and communications.

## Additional Considerations

- **Scalability:** Design architecture to handle increased traffic during disasters and future growth.
- **Offline Functionality:** Provide limited offline capabilities for users in areas with unstable internet connectivity.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure app accessibility for users with disabilities and consider bandwidth-efficient options for low-connectivity regions.

## Technologies

- **Backend:** Node.js for server-side logic and API development.
- **Database:** MongoDB or PostgreSQL for data storage and retrieval.
- **AI Integration:** GeminiAPI for real-time data analysis and AI-driven features.
- **Frontend:** React or Angular for a responsive user interface.
- **Mapping:** Google Maps API or Mapbox for interactive mapping features.
- **Messaging:** Socket.io or Firebase for real-time messaging.
